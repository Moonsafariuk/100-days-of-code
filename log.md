 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 02 Jan, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Working in: C# - on Terminal Hacking Game.
Managed to finally get my buttons working. Several things must happen when the button is clicked and must happen in a set order but depend on the input. The problem was that the correct events were not happening in the correct order. After breaking down the problem into the logical steps I was able to find that the problem was caused by the order of events and actually required a slight tweaking of the methods being used. This also meant that one method was no longer needed as it was now duplicating some of the functionally previously required.

**Thoughts:** Breaking down the logical steps the code must follow in comments before writing the code is quite useful!
