 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 02 Jan, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Working in: C# - on Terminal Hacking Game.
Managed to finally get my buttons working. Several things must happen when the button is clicked and must happen in a set order but depend on the input. The problem was that the correct events were not happening in the correct order. After breaking down the problem into the logical steps I was able to find that the problem was caused by the order of events and actually required a slight tweaking of the methods being used. This also meant that one method was no longer needed as it was now duplicating some of the functionally previously required.

**Thoughts:** Breaking down the logical steps the code must follow in comments before writing the code is quite useful!

### Day 1: 03 Feb, 2017 (Updated day after!)

**Today's Progress**: Started SoloLearn PHP course. This is just to go over the basics for a PHP project I am to start work on soon. 

**Thoughts:** Quite good and not as difficult as I remember PHP to have been the first time I saw it!

### Day 2: 04 Jan, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Debugging someone else's code in C#. Helped implement a few improvements to their code and made some suggestions about what to do differently. The problem was to do with selecting random things from one list and moving them to another list. 

**Thoughts:** Started with suggestions rather than just doing it for them. So for example suggested using a second list to hold the random character strings before using them elsewhere. This allowed the random process to work and avoided using the same strings twice. After their solution (which was 30 ish if else statments) suggested using a loop instead but had to provide help to make this work.

### Day 3: 05 Jan, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Code review with my tutor on my C# project. We looked at how my code was structured and worked together to remove dependences on Window's Form elements so that the methods and objects could work elsewhere. A change included changing parameters from Windows objects to strings. Also looked at what other objects could be added in the future when more database elements are added. 

**Thoughts:** Went quite well but left my code a mess which will take a bit of time to get back in order, however the changes are beneficial in the long run!

### Day 8 : 17th Jan, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Just more PHP and SQL today. Discussed SQL table set up for PHP project. Started on creation of web forms etc. Still unsure of what tables we will use so can't progress a huge amount yet so just working on general bits at the moment.

**Thoughts:** SQL plans can be quite complicated!
